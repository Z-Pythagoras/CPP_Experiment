1. Here is the codes：

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void main()
{
	cout << "Hello World!\n";
}


Add some codes and get the results as follows:

Initialize
Hello, World!
Clear up


NOTES: Don't modify the MAIN function any way!



2.Define an integer set class which is named Set with some memeber functions as follows:
  a. IsExist(): To judge if an integer is a member of a Set or not;
  b. RemoveItem(): To delete an integer from the Set;
  c. IsEqual(): To judge if two Sets are equal or not;
  d. Intersection(): To intersection with another Set; (交集）
  e. Union: To union with another Set. （并集）
  f. AddItem(): To add an integer to Set. 
     Note: Add an integer successfully when this integer is NOT in the Set and there are enough space to save in the Set.
  
NOTES:In order to complement Set class, you can define constructor, member functions with available arguments as well as destrctor if you need.




3.Create a class, IntChar, to archieve an integer to save a string which length is no more than 4.
  Suppose that a character length is 1 byte.

  For example: "Love", it's binary form associated with an integer is：0100 1100 0110 1111 0111 0110 0110 0101
               If the string length is less than 4 characters, the remaining part is made up by zero.

 
  NOTES:
  (1) You can define appropriate member functions and variables;
  (2) The string type in C++ is FORBIDDEN in the IntChar;
  (3) In main, programmer can call member function in the following way.
 
  void main()
  {
      IntChar IC("Love");

      IC.ASC_Print();      // Print the content with string format:  Love
      IC.Binary_Print();   // Print the content with binary format:  0100 1100 0110 1111 0111 0110 0110 0101
      IC.Int_Print();      // Print the content with integer format: 1282373221
  }
