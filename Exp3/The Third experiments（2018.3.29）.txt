1. Define MyString class with demands as follows:
   1.1  The class, MyString, can save any string which means an arbitary length;

   1.2  Overload operator+() to append string to another one;

   1.3  Define Find() function to locate the first position of searching a character or a string;

   1.4  Define Mid() function to get substring from one string;

   1.5  The client can use MyString you defined like as in the main:

   void main()
   {
       MyString s1("China"), s2;

       s2 = "Love";
       cout << "I" + s2 + s1;

       int pos = s1.Find('a');     // pos is 4, or zero if  'a'  is not found.

       int a = 1, b = 3;
       MyString my = s2.Mid(a, b); // a represents starting position, b represents the length. So Mid can get a substring.
   }

   NOTE: The type such as string and template in C++, and string library in C and C++ are both FORBIDDEN in your program.
         The only one you can define is char*.



2. Define InternetURL class to save a URL string like as "www.bit.edu.cn"£¬and finish the demands as follows:
   2.1  Use MyString you just finished before to save URL string£»

   2.2  Define member function getDomain() to get domain from URL. 
        For example, we can get   "www.bit.edu.cn"   from "www.bit.edu.cn/jwc/080329.html"£»

   2.3  Define member function getDomainCountry() to get country name in the domain from URL, such as "us", "uk", etc.
        For example, we can get   "cn"   from """www.bit.edu.cn/jwc/080329.html"£»

   2.4  Define member function getDomainType() to get domain type from URL, such as "gov", "com", "org", and so on.
        For example, we can get   "edu"   from """www.bit.edu.cn/jwc/080329.html"£»

   2.5  The client can use MyString you defined like as in the main:
        void main()
   	{
       		InternetURL URL("www.bit.edu.cn/jwc/080329.html"), s2;
       		
       		cout << URL.GetDomain();         // The result is:  www.bit.edu.cn

       		cout << URL.GetDomainCountry();  // The result is:  cn

                cout << URL.GetDomainType();     // The result is:  edu
   	}




3£®Create a class, LINT, to save a big integer which is no more than 100 digits.
   Define a member function to achieve the sum of two big numbers such as following:

class LINT
{
private:
    ¡­¡­
public:
    LINT Add(const LINT&  L);  // Achieve the sum of two big numbers
    ostream& operator<<(ostream&, const LINT&);
    ¡­¡­
};

   NOTES: 
   1. You can define appropriate member functions and variables.
   2. String type in C++ is forbidden in your progarm, you can use char*.
